Aim
To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types).

Algorithm
Start the program.

Declare an integer variable. Prompt the user and read an integer. Print its value and size.

Declare a float variable. Prompt the user and read a float. Print its value and size.

Declare a string variable. Prompt the user and read a word. Print its value and size.

Declare a double variable. Prompt the user and read a double. Print its value and size.

Declare a char variable. Prompt the user and read a character. Print its value and size.

Declare a bool variable. Prompt the user and read a boolean value (true/false). Print its value and size.

End the program.

Theory
This C++ program demonstrates the usage of fundamental data types: int, float, string, double, char, and bool.

The cin object is used to take input from the user, and cout is used to display output on the screen.

The program shows how to accept input for each data type and display both the value and the size using the sizeof operator.

It helps understand how much memory each data type consumes and how user interaction works in C++ using I/O streams.

Conclusion
The program successfully demonstrates how to take user input and display both the value and size of various C++ data types.

It provides a clear understanding of memory usage and input/output handling for each data type in C++.

This practical gives foundational knowledge required for working with variables and data types in C++ programming
